# 🎮 Number Guessing Game  
A fun and interactive **console-based Java game** where the player tries to guess a random number within a limited number of attempts.  
The game includes **round tracking, score calculation**, and **real-time feedback** after every guess.

## 💡 Overview  
This project was developed as **Task 3** during the **CodSoft Java Internship – Batch B54 (September 2025)**.  
It focuses on **core Java logic**, emphasizing **loops, conditionals, random number generation**, and **user input handling** through the console.

## 🚀 Features

- Console-based interaction
- Random number generation and feedback ("Too High" / "Too Low")  
- Score tracking based on attempts  
- Multiple rounds with cumulative scoring  
- Replay option after each game  
- Clean and modular Java code  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Java  
- Eclipse IDE  
- Console I/O (Scanner Class)  
- Random Number Generation (`java.util.Random`)  
- Object-Oriented Programming
