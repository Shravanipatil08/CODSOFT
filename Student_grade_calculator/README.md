# 🧮 Student Grade Calculator  
A simple and interactive **Java console-based application** that takes the number of subjects and their respective marks from the user, then calculates the **total**, **average**, and assigns a **grade** based on performance.

## 💡 Overview  
This project was developed as **Task 2** during the **CodSoft Java Internship – Batch B54 (September 2025)**.  
It focuses on strengthening **core Java fundamentals**, including **arrays, loops, conditionals**, and **user input handling** using the `Scanner` class.

## 🚀 Features  
- Input any number of subjects dynamically  
- Accepts marks through console input  
- Calculates total and average marks  
- Assigns grades automatically based on average score   
- Displays results neatly in the console  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Java  
- Eclipse IDE  
- Console I/O (`Scanner` class)  
- Conditional & Looping Statements  
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
